Hello and thank you for considering me as a candidate for Bottle Rocket. I had a blast working on this assignment and learned a ton, including how to work with the Google Maps SDK.

To start up my application, please npm install the dependencies. Then simultaneously run npm start and npm run build to start the server and compile the code through Webpack.

If you have any questions about anything, please reach out to me at timothyhansen229@gmail.com

I look forward to hearing back from the team.
